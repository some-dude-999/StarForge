# Git Rules

**If it's not on main branch, it FAILED.**

- Always commit and push immediately after any code change
- Always work directly on main branch
- Only branch if GitHub technically requires it, then immediately merge to main
- Verify changes are on main before considering task complete

Not on main = useless code.
