=== AUTO PRODUCT PHOTO COVER.txt ===
PROJECT: SFK (Starforge Forge Kit)
COMPONENT: Starforge Image Processor - Product Photo Cover Generator
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- User Input: Image files (JPG/PNG) via drag-and-drop or file picker
- User Input: Top text field (default: "STARFORGE")
- User Input: Bottom text field (default: "Unlock All STARFORGE STL Files & Sell 3D Prints for Only $10")
- Font CDN: Google Fonts - Orbitron (700, 900 weights) and Inter (400, 600 weights)
- External Library: JSZip 3.10.1 (from cdnjs.cloudflare.com)

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Batch process product images by adding branded cover/frame with customizable text
- Key Functions:
  * handleFiles(files) - Validates and queues image files for processing
  * processImage(file) - Loads individual image file and triggers processing
  * createProcessedImage(img, filename) - Core canvas rendering function that:
    - Creates 1080x1080 canvas with dark gray background (#2c2c2c)
    - Draws top branding box (180px height) with horizontal line and bottom border
    - Centers and scales original image in 740x740 rounded box with orange border
    - Renders "STARFORGE" text (or custom) using Orbitron font with background box
    - Adds bottom promotional text using Inter font
  * addToGallery(dataUrl, originalFilename) - Creates preview card in gallery
  * downloadImage(dataUrl, originalFilename) - Triggers individual JPEG download
  * loadFonts() - Preloads Orbitron font to prevent rendering issues
- Event Handlers:
  * Drop zone: drag-and-drop file upload
  * "Process All Images" button: batch processes all queued images
  * "Download All" button: downloads all processed images individually with 2-second delay
  * "Download as ZIP" button: packages all processed images into single ZIP archive
  * "Clear All" button: resets application state
  * Individual "Download Image" buttons in gallery

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Individual downloads: "[cleaned_name] StarForge Kits 3D Print STL File.jpg"
- ZIP download: "starforge_images_[timestamp].zip"
- Filename cleaning: Apostrophes and periods replaced with underscores
- Image format: JPEG at 95% quality
- Canvas size: 1080x1080 pixels (Instagram/social media optimized)

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries:
  * JSZip 3.10.1 - ZIP file generation
  * Google Fonts API - Orbitron and Inter fonts
- Browser APIs:
  * Canvas API (2D context with willReadFrequently flag)
  * File API (FileReader for image loading)
  * Drag and Drop API
  * FontFace API for font preloading
- Project Files: None (standalone tool)

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: User file uploads (browser File API)
- Sends data to: User downloads (browser download mechanism)
- Triggers: User interaction (drag-drop, button clicks)
- Standalone: No integration with other SFK tools

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Canvas: 1080x1080px (social media standard)
- Top Box: 180px height, #1a1a1a background
- Image Box: 740x740px with 30px border radius, 10px orange border (#d97706)
- Top Text: Orbitron Bold 96px, #f0ead6 color, centered with background box
- Bottom Text: Inter 35px, #c4bfac color, 20px margin from bottom
- Color Scheme: Dark theme (#2a2a2a body, #333 containers, #f0ead6 accents)

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Font preloading prevents text rendering issues
- willReadFrequently flag optimizes canvas pixel reading
- 2-second delay between downloads prevents browser blocking
- Async/await pattern for sequential image processing
- Promise-based image loading

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: This might use backend processing
- Actually: Fully client-side using Canvas API
- Why this matters: No server required, works offline, fast processing

- Initially thought: Images might be PNG format
- Actually: All outputs are JPEG at 95% quality
- Why this matters: Smaller file sizes for social media sharing

NOTES:
- Font loading has fallback mechanism for reliability
- Filename cleaning prevents filesystem issues
- Image scaling uses "cover" behavior (fills entire box, crops if needed)
- Gallery provides instant preview of processed images
- ZIP functionality crucial for batch workflows
- No image quality or size validation (assumes user provides appropriate content)
- Pending files list shows queue before processing
- Processing indicator shows active status during batch operations

USE CASE:
Primary use case is e-commerce product photography for Starforge's 3D printing business.
Allows quick branding of multiple product photos for social media, marketplace listings,
and promotional materials. The 1080x1080 format is optimized for Instagram and other
social platforms.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add configurable canvas size options
- Allow custom color schemes
- Support for logo uploads
- Text position customization
- Preview before processing
- Undo functionality
